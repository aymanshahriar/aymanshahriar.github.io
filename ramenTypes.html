          <p>Sapporo, the capital of Japan’s northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido, is known as the birthplace of miso-style ramen. Miso ramen is so popular among locals, in fact, that the city has not one but two ramen “alleys”: Ganso Ramen Yokocho and Shin Ramen Yokocho. To make this local specialty, fragrant soybean paste is sauteed together with ginger and garlic and mixed together with pork broth for a hearty bowl of ramen that hits the spot on even the coldest winter days. Toppings include roasted chashu  pork, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts. You can also request to add corn and a creamy pat of butter, two local Hokkaido specialty products.</p>

          <p>Tonkotsu ramen from Hakata (modern-day Fukuoka) is a unique style of ramen made from pork bones boiled at a high temperature until they release their collagen, creating a rich and milky broth that’s cut with seafood stock. The ramen is served with thin straight noodles cooked to just under al dente and topped with thick slices of roasted pork, garlic, sesame seeds, and pickled ginger. If you finish the noodles quickly, it’s common practice to order a second helping, called kaedama. Although tonkotsu ramen originated in Kyushu, it has spread all throughout Japan and to many countries around the world.</p>

          <p>Known for its hand-cut noodles, the Kitakata area of northern Fukuoka specializes in ramen made with fat, wavy egg noodles. It’s served in a shoyu (soy sauce) based soup together with simple toppings: a few pieces of chashu pork, bamboo shoots, and a piece of naruto, a fish cake with a spiral of pink and white color. Although the ingredients may seem fairly basic, a bowl of Kitakata ramen fits many Japanese people’s quintessential image of what ramen looks like.</p>

          <p>In Wakayama prefecture, it’s common practice among the locals to ask for chuka soba, or “Chinese-style noodles”, rather than ramen. You’ll get a bowl of tonkotsu-shoyu ramen that blends together the pork bone broth popular in western Japan and the soy sauce-based ramen broth popular in eastern Japan. The noodles are thin and stick straight, similar to Hakata ramen, and topped with a generous helping of scallions as well as a slice of the pink-and-white naruto fish cake that usually comes with shoyu ramen. It’s also common to have your ramen here with a side of haya-zushi, a traditional Kansai-style pressed sushi made with pickled mackerel.</p>

          <p>Onomichi is a seaside town in Hiroshima prefecture located on the Seto Inland Sea, so it should come as no surprise that their regional style of ramen is made with fresh local seafood. The shoyu-based broth also contains chicken and a bit of pork, but the real star of the show is the layer of rich pork back fat suspended on top, giving it a punch of flavor. Hundreds of people a day feverishly line up at the town’s numerous ramen shops for a taste of Onomichi ramen.</p>

          <p>Despite its name, “Taiwan ramen,” Nagoya’s local style of ramen isn’t a direct import from Taiwan, although it is inspired by Taiwanese cooking. It’s named for the Taiwanese chef who invented the dish based on Taiwanese danzai noodles. Taiwan ramen features ramen noodles in a shoyu broth topped with spicy ground pork and nira (garlic chives). The dish pre-dates the spicy food trend in Japan, but its popularity has held strong and fast over the decades!</p>
